<h1>Forecasting Churn and SQL Insights</h1>

<h2>Churn Prediction Model</h2>
<p>We developed a churn prediction model based on user engagement data. Key features include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Daily Active Time:</strong> Measures engagement; low activity indicates churn risk.</li>
    <li><strong>Days Since Last Login:</strong> Recency of user activity.</li>
    <li><strong>Purchases:</strong> Monetary engagement through in-game purchases.</li>
</ul>
<p>The model predicts churn probabilities, which are visualized on the dashboard. Users with high churn probabilities can be targeted with retention campaigns.</p>

<h2>SQL Query Insights</h2>
<p>The following SQL queries provide actionable insights:</p>

<h3>Query 1: Total Deposits for Male Users</h3>
This query helps assess user monetary engagement, a critical factor for predicting churn or categorizing high-value users.

<pre>
SELECT 
    u.User_id, 
    COALESCE(SUM(CASE 
        WHEN d.amount > 10 AND d.time_stamp >= '2017-01-01' THEN d.amount 
        ELSE 0 
    END), 0) AS Total_Deposits
FROM Users u
LEFT JOIN Deposits d ON u.User_id = d.User_id
WHERE u.Gender = 'M'
GROUP BY u.User_id;
</pre>

<h3>Query 2: Salesperson Metrics</h3>
This query helps identify high-performing salespeople and their top industries, aiding in resource allocation and strategy.

<pre>
SELECT 
    s.Salesperson_id,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN o.amount > 1000 THEN 1 END) AS Orders_Above_1000,
    CASE 
        WHEN MAX(CASE WHEN o.amount > 500 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 1 THEN 1 
        ELSE 0 
    END AS Had_Order_Above_500,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.Customer_id) AS Unique_Customers,
    DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), MAX(o.Order_date)) AS Days_Since_Last_Order
FROM Salesperson s
LEFT JOIN Orders o ON s.Salesperson_id = o.Salesperson_id
GROUP BY s.Salesperson_id;
</pre>
